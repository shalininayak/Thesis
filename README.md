Our business problem is to find product recommendations for each Yuty customer based on their inputs and data samples using unsupervised machine learning models and provides business analysis on it.

The business objective is to make a text classification model. By analysing the dataset, we used an unsupervised learning method with the univariate variable as descriptive statistics as our analysis i.e., ingredients. 

The main aim of the project was to build a recommendation system that recommends top three Yuty products for each of the Yuty customers. With this aim in mind, we were able to build four different models of recommendation systems using four different machine learning techniques – K-means, Multinomial Naïve Bayes, Random Forest Classifier, and Cosine Similarity.
Yuty provided us with eight different data files of CSV and JSON origin. The first step that we took regarding our project was understanding these datasets and doing some initial exploratory data analysis on them. We identified the missing values in the datasets and after talking to our mentors, we decided to drop those missing values to build our recommendation system. After that, we cleaned the dataset and created features. These features help us to decide the efficiency of the recommendation system.

Every step that we have done and analysed concludes a business insight that can help Yuty to grow their business.
Once our features were built, we implemented the four machine learning models that are mentioned above. We concluded that the cosine similarity machine learning technique gave us the best recommendations as the accuracy for this model was 52.03% among the other three models which couldn’t perform very well due to lack of richness in data quality, other than random forest which gave the second-best accuracy for product recommendation.
